    <h2>The Innovators by Walter Isaacson</h2>
    <p>
        <i>The Innovators</i> is a brilliant and detailed book that tells the story of the people behind the computer and the internet — the most important inventions of our time. 
        It starts with Ada Lovelace, who is often considered the first computer programmer, and continues through the lives of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs who shaped the digital age.

    <p>
        The book explores how key innovations — like the transistor, programming languages, personal computers, and the internet — came to life. Walter Isaacson does a great job 
        of showing that the digital revolution was not the work of one genius, but of <b>teams of thinkers, coders, and builders</b> who collaborated and inspired each other.

    <p>
        Some of the major figures in the book include Alan Turing, Grace Hopper, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Tim Berners-Lee. It’s an inspiring read for anyone interested in 
        computer science, showing how innovation comes from curiosity, collaboration, and passion.
